    software architecture
        The software architecture for a system is the structure or structures of that system, which comprise software
        elements, the externally-visible properties of those elements, and the relationships among them
        :cite:`bass2012software`. ”Externally visible” properties refers to those assumptions other elements can make
        of an element, such as its provided services, performance characteristics, fault handling, shared resource
        usage, and so on. This definition provides the basic litmus test for what information is included in this
        document, and what information is relegated to downstream documentation.

    structure
        Modern systems are more than complex enough to make it difficult to grasp them all at once. Instead, we restrict
        our attention at any one moment to one (or a small number) of the software system’s structures. To communicate
        meaningfully about an architecture, we must make clear which structure or structures we are discussing at the
        moment - which view we are taking of the architecture :cite:`bass2012software`.
