How this documentation is organized
***********************************
This documentation is organized into the following sections:

- :ref:`roadmap` **provides information about this document and its intended audience.** It provides the
  roadmap and document overview. Every reader who wishes to find information relevant to the software architecture
  described in this document should begin by reading :ref:`roadmap`, which describes how the document
  is organized, which stakeholder viewpoints are represented, how stakeholders are expected to use it, and where
  information may be found. :ref:`roadmap` also provides information about the views that are used by this
  documentation to communicate the software architecture.
- :ref:`architecture_background` **explains why the architecture is what it is.** It provides a system overview,
  establishing the context and goals of the implementation. It describes the background and rationale for the
  :term:`software architecture`. It explains the constraints and influences that led to the current architecture, and it
  describes the major architectural approaches that have been utilized in the architecture.
- :ref:`views` and :ref:`view_relations` **specify the software architecture.** Views specify elements of software and
  the relationships between them. A view corresponds to a viewpoint (see :ref:`roadmap/viewpoint_definitions`), and is a
  representation of one or more :term:`structures <structure>` present in the software (see
  :ref:`roadmap/purpose_and_scope/multiple_structures`).
- :ref:`bibliography` and :ref:`directory` **provide reference information for the reader**. :ref:`bibliography`
  provides look-up information for documents that are cited elsewhere in this documentation. :ref:`directory` is a
  directory, which is an index of architectural elements and relations telling where each one is defined and used in
  this documentation. The section also includes a glossary and acronym list.
