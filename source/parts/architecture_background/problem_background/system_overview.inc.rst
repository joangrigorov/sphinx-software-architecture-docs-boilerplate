This section provides a high-level summary of the system, outlining its primary purpose, core functionality, and
alignment with business objectives. It describes the problem the system is intended to solve, the key stakeholders it
serves, and how it fits into the broader organizational or technical ecosystem. The overview should offer sufficient
context to help both technical and non-technical readers understand the systemâ€™s role and value within the business.
