Goals and Context
#################
The goal of this software architecture document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture of the
{PROJECT_NAME} platform. Since the platform was already mature at the time of writing, the document is intended to serve
as a reference for developers and all other stakeholders. It aims to provide a high-level understanding of the system's
structure, its components, and the interactions between them. The document also describes the significant driving
requirements that shaped the architecture, as well as the quality attributes that the architecture aims to achieve.

Furthermore, this document is used for further development of the platform. It serves as a reference for developers to
understand the architecture and make informed decisions when evolving the platform in ways that impact the architecture.
See :ref:`roadmap/update_process` for more information on how the document is maintained.
